/// <summary>
/// Class that handles the stocks (lives) of a fighter/player
/// Note that it also deals with the checks that player should lose a life,
/// ie. falling out of the map, or losing all their health.
/// Author(s): Jason Cheung, Matthew Kan
/// Date: Nov 18 2022
/// Source(s):
///     FPS Unity & Photon Fusion EP4.1 (player names and RPCs): https://youtu.be/-opvmn_QKw0?t=647
/// Remarks: 
/// - Stock is affected by listening to player health.
/// - stock is a networked property so the NetworkFighterObserver will know of its changes.
/// Change History: Nov 22 2022 - Lukasz Bednarek
/// - Modified stock to be a networked property, will call the NetworkFighterObserver to update its UI.
/// - Add logic for RPC call for sound effect method.
