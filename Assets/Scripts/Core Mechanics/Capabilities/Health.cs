/// <summary>
/// Class that handles the current / max health of a fighter/player.
/// Author(s): Faiz Hassany, Jason Cheung
/// Date: Nov 07 2022
/// Source(s):
///     FPS Unity & Photon Fusion EP4.1 (player names and RPCs): https://youtu.be/-opvmn_QKw0?t=647
/// Remarks: 
/// - Health value is affected by attack, and it affects stock.
/// - health is a networked property so the NetworkFighterObserver will know of its changes.
/// Change History: Nov 22 2022 - Lukasz Bednarek
/// - Modified health to be a networked property, will call the NetworkFighterObserver to update its UI.
/// - Reorganized code to be more consistent with other capabilities.
/// - Moved some of the logic to Stock.cs
/// - Add logic for RPC call for sound effect method.
